# Clipping-algorithm
This is a script which clipps a shape out of triangles at the edges of a screen through linear interpolation. Its made in Gamemaker language but it can be easily converted into any language.
Clipping a triangle is common in 2D or even 3D-Engines. Its intention is to limit the amount of triangles a program needs to render. The performance can be improved by avoiding to draw any triangle outside of the main screen. The amount of calculations every triangle needs to go through is quite high, so it can be pretty useful to lower the amount of triangles to the ones which are visible on your display.
